# Project Exam 2

This project was done to show what we have learned during the last two years. We were to create an hotel booking website with both customer-facing and admin sections. We were to create a backend and frontend.

## Description

In this project I created a hotel booking site using Strapi as my backend and Nextjs as my frontend. The site has the functions to create a booking, send a message to admin, and have admin read bookings and messages sendt in. Also admin can create a new hotel. Due to error I don't know how to fix, this site is not up an running. It only works on local server.
